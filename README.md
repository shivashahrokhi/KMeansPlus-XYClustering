# K-Means Clustering

## Overview
This Python script offers a robust solution for performing K-means clustering on datasets containing X and Y coordinates. It's designed to efficiently group data points into clusters for a variety of data analysis tasks.

## Features
- **Multiple Initializations**: Ensures reliable clustering by initializing centroids multiple times.
- **Optimal Clustering**: Runs the K-means algorithm with different starting points to avoid suboptimal clusters.
- **Accuracy**: Selects the best outcome from multiple runs to guarantee the most accurate clustering results.
